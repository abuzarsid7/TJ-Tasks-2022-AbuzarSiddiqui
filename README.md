Algorithm:  

° To find, if the integer 'n' is a power of two we need to find
 if the integer is a factor of two and leaves remainder 
 Zero, every time we divide it by two.  

If the remainder is not Zero, the integer is not a power of two.

Algorithm:  
° To find, the number of Common Factors of the given intgers 'a' and 'b', we
need to find about how many the times an integer 'x' which is a common factor of both 'a' and 'b', divides the integers 'a' and 'b'
and leaves the remainder Zero.  
The number of times, we get the remainder Zero, the number of Common Factors the integers 'a' and 'b'  has. Then, we need to count it, and that gives us the result.
